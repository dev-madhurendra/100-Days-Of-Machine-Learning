## 1. What is Machine Learning ?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. It enables computers to learn patterns from data and utilize that knowledge to perform tasks or make predictions.

### Explanation with Example

Imagine you want to build a program that can predict whether an email is spam or not spam (ham). Instead of manually writing rules to classify emails, you can use machine learning.

1. **Data Collection:** Gather a dataset of emails, each labeled as spam or not spam (ham).
   
2. **Feature Extraction:** Extract features from the emails, such as word frequency, presence of specific phrases, or email length.

3. **Training Phase:** Feed the labeled dataset into a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm learns from the data, identifying patterns that differentiate spam from non-spam emails.

4. **Model Building:** After training, the algorithm builds a model representing learned patterns. The model captures the relationship between email features and their labels (spam or not spam).

5. **Prediction:** When a new email arrives, input its features into the trained model. The model analyzes these features and predicts whether the email is spam or not based on learned patterns.

6. **Evaluation and Improvement:** Evaluate the model's performance using a separate test dataset. Refine the model by adjusting parameters, using different algorithms, or gathering more data.
